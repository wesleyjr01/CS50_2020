# Finance App
* We’ll take the concepts we’ve seen to create CS50 Finance, a virtual stock trading website with an account for users to register for, the ability to get quotes for shares of stocks and to virtually buy or sell them. We’ll also have a history page for each account to see what we’ve done in the past.
* [2:45] We look at the distribution code for CS50 Finance, or the code that we’ll all start off with. We have an application.py file that our Flask app will run, with various configuration options, a connection to a database file finance.db, and routes for . **This follows the MVC, Model-View-Controller, pattern, which generally separates the concerns of data and how that’s stored (our database), the views that display some amount of data (our templates), and controllers that control the logic of what is displayed when (our application.py routes)**.
* [5:30] Notice that our routes also have a @login_required decorator, or extra attribute in Python to indicate that the function should behave differently. Flask allows us to automatically redirect users to a login page, and we have the login functionality implemented in our distribution code too. The /login route checks whether a matching user and password exists in our database (for a POST method, as from the login form), or displays the login form for a GET method. And in our database, instead of storing the user’s raw password, which is more insecure since hackers might use them against other websites, we store the hash of their password which is sufficient for verification, but difficult from which to recover the original password.
